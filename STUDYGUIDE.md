DATA STRUCTURES STUDY GUIDE:book::book::book:
===========================


Welcome to my CS 112 study guide. There are a few references to the textbook within the study guide so
be prepared to use it. There are also many links to videos to help you understand topics covered in 
the course. I try and choose videos that have the shortest and best explanations possible to make learning 
the course material as quick and easy as possible. The videos are helpful, but some concepts are difficult to
grasp and therefore the textbook is a gold mine of information for your full understanding of certain concepts.





Part I:  Linear Structures
=========================
:boom: Linear structures are the easiest part of CS 112, so make sure you take advantage of this and destroy the first exam and the first few assignments that use linear data structures. :boom:

Linked Lists
-------------
Circular Linked Lists and doubly linked lists donâ€™t usually appear on exams, but it is still good to learn them
to increase your understanding of linked lists in general.

[Imagining a Linked List (Sesh Venugopal)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ri3Qm5A4Dk)
  - Definition (Linked List): Linear structure consisting of nodes. Each node contains a piece of data and a pointer that     points to the next node in the linked list.
  - Difference between linked list and array:

          Operation           |     Array                  | Linked List
          ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------
          Access              |    Random                  | Sequential from beginning of list (in order)
          Insertion/Deletion  | entries have to be shifted |Nothing must be done to entries
          Storage             |Allocated in one shot (initial size of array cannot change)| Allocated only when needed (Initial size of list can change)
