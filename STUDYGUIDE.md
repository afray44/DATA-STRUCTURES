STUDY GUIDE
===========


Welcome to my CS 112 study guide. There are a few references to the textbook within the study guide so
be prepared to use it. There are also many links to videos to help you understand topics covered in 
the course. I try and choose videos that have the shortest and best explanations possible to make learning 
the course material as quick and easy as possible. The videos are helpful, but some concepts are difficult to
grasp and therefore the textbook is a gold mine of information for your full understanding of certain concepts.

Part I:  Linear Structures

|Linked Lists|
--------------
Circular Linked Lists and doubly linked lists donâ€™t usually appear on exams, but it is still good to learn them
to increase your understanding of linked lists in general.
