STUDY GUIDE
===========


Welcome to my CS 112 study guide. There are a few references to the textbook within the study guide so
be prepared to use it. There are also many links to videos to help you understand topics covered in 
the course. I try and choose videos that have the shortest and best explanations possible to make learning 
the course material as quick and easy as possible.
